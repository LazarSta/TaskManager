            <h1>What's this website about?</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Task Manager! This website is a personal project aimed at helping individuals like
                myself efficiently organize and manage my tasks for the short term.</p>
            <p> If you've ever felt overwhelmed by a long to-do list, unsure of where to start or how to prioritize your
                tasks, you're not alone. That's why I created this platform. The idea for this website came from my own
                need for better task management in my daily life. I found myself juggling various responsibilities and
                struggling to stay organized amidst the chaos of everyday life. Recognizing the importance of effective
                time management and task prioritization, I set out to create a solution that would streamline this
                process and make it easier for individuals to stay on top of their daily commitments.</p>
            <p> My ultimate goal with this website is to empower you to take control of your time, maximize your
                productivity, and ultimately achieve a greater sense of balance and fulfillment in your daily life. By
                providing tools and resources to enhance your organizational skills and decision-making process, I hope
                to help you make the most out of each day and pursue your goals with confidence. </p>
            <h1>So what does this mean?</h1>
            <p>Nothing! Just want to thank you for visiting my Task Manager! I hope you find the tools and resources
                here helpful in your journey towards better time management and productivity.</p>
