# TaskManager
A task management and weather look-up web app I developed using HTML, JS and CSS

This was a final project for a course I took in web-development. It focused on vanilla HTML, JS and CSS and to understand the core as to how these three languages communicate.

# How to run

-- I suggest using the VSCode extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey --

Upon opening the project, you should run a Live Server session on index.html, which should bring you to the homepage of my Task Manager website
