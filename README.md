# TaskManager
A task management and weather look-up web app I developed using HTML, JS and CSS

This was a final project for a course I took in web-development. It focused on vanilla HTML, JS and CSS and to understand the core as to how these three languages communicate.

# How to run

Simple open the project folder in and run Server.java.

It will prompt you with a Server Configuration window and request a port. (I suggest for test purposes you use the "Use Default Port" checkbox)

Upon starting the server, you can now run Client.java which in turn will prompt you with Instance Options, where you can input a Host, Port and Username. (Again, for testing purposes, please use the "default values" checkbox)

Press OK and you should now see a chatroom that stores history locally on your system.
